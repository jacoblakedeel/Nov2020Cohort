# Please enter your name: Eric
# Hello, Eric!


# Prompt the user for his name using the input function. Example:

name = input("What is your name? ")

print(f"Hello, {name}!")

# Same as the first exercise, but this time print the user's
# name in ALL CAPS, and also tell them the number of letters in their name.

name = input("What is your name? ").upper()

print(f"Hello, {name}!")

# (Hint: You'll want to search for documentation on how to uppercase a string.)
